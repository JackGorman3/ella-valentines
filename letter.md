Smelly,
Happy Valentines day! I had such a ball last week when you came to visit me for my birthday- you really do know how to make me feel special. Even though we celebrated big v-day last week I still wanted to do something special on the day.
I am so glad I get to have you in my life and for how much better you make it. You're my lover, friend, and rage bait victim, and I wouldn't want it any other way. 
I hope we don't get in the habbit of not being together on valentine's days for the future!
Love,
Jark
